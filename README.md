## Environment Configuration
when start the server, set the environment variable NODE_ENV to either "dev" or "prod"
this will pick the correct ".env" file with the related configuration for that environement.

At the moment, NODE_ENV="prod" is used the script (package.json -> scripts -> start)

update the related configs in "env/dev.env" or "env/prod.env"
